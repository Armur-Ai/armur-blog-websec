```shell
$ wpscan --url https://example.com --enumerate ap

[+] Enumerating API (via Passive and Aggressive Methods)
[i] REST API Information
[+] WordPress REST API v2 available
 | Found By: Headers
 | Url: https://example.com/wp-json/
 | Version: 2
[+] REST API Endpoints
 | /wp/v2/posts
 | /wp/v2/pages
 | /wp/v2/users
 | /wp/v2/media
 | /wp/v2/types
 | /wp/v2/statuses
 | /wp/v2/taxonomies
 | /wp/v2/categories
 | /wp/v2/tags
 | /wp/v2/comments
 | /wp/v2/settings
 | /wp/v2/themes
```

This output shows the available REST API endpoints, which could potentially be exploited if not properly secured.

### 5. Custom Wordlist Support
