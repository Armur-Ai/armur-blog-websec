## Introduction

This tutorial explores essential concepts in network security, focusing on network scanning with Nmap, understanding IP addressing and subnetting, and introducing intrusion detection systems (IDS) like Snort and Suricata. 

### IP Addressing and Subnetting

Every device connected to a network needs a unique identifier, which is its IP address. IP addresses are used to route traffic across networks. Subnetting is the process of dividing a large network into smaller, more manageable subnetworks. This improves network efficiency and security.

### Nmap: The Network Mapper

Nmap is a powerful and versatile open-source tool for network discovery and security auditing. It allows you to:

* **Discover hosts and services:** Identify active devices and the services they are running.
* **Scan for open ports:** Determine which ports are open on a target system.
* **Detect operating systems:** Identify the operating system running on a target device.
* **Run scripts:** Execute custom scripts for advanced scanning and vulnerability assessment.

### Snort and Suricata: Intrusion Detection Systems

Snort and Suricata are open-source intrusion detection systems (IDS) that monitor network traffic for malicious activity. They analyze packets against predefined rules and alert you to potential threats.

## Mastering Nmap for Network Scanning

Let's explore Nmap with practical examples.

**Step 1: Install Nmap**

Download and install Nmap from the official website: [Nmap Download](https://nmap.org/download.html)

**Step 2: Basic Host Discovery**

To discover active hosts on a network, use the `-sn` flag:

```bash
nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24 
```

This command scans the entire network range `192.168.1.0/24` and lists all active hosts.

**Step 3: Port Scanning**

To scan for open ports on a specific host, use the `-p` flag:

```bash
nmap -p 80,443 192.168.1.100 
```

This command scans ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS) on the host `192.168.1.100`.

**Step 4: OS Detection**

To detect the operating system running on a target, use the `-O` flag:

```bash
nmap -O 192.168.1.100
```

**Step 5: Advanced Scanning Techniques**

Nmap offers various advanced scanning techniques, including:

* **TCP SYN Scan (`-sS`):** A stealthy scan that doesn't complete the TCP handshake.
* **UDP Scan (`-sU`):** Scans for open UDP ports.
* **Version Detection (`-sV`):** Identifies the version of services running on open ports.
* **Script Scanning (`-sC`):** Runs default Nmap scripts for vulnerability assessment.

**Example: Comprehensive Scan**

To perform a comprehensive scan, combining multiple techniques:

```bash
nmap -sS -sV -sC -O 192.168.1.100
```

This command performs a SYN scan, detects versions of services, runs default scripts, and attempts to identify the operating system.

## Understanding Snort and Suricata

Snort and Suricata are rule-based IDS. They analyze network traffic and compare it against predefined rules. If a packet matches a rule, an alert is triggered.

**Step 1: Install Snort/Suricata**

Installation instructions vary depending on your operating system. Refer to the official documentation for your specific platform.

**Step 2: Configure Rules**

Snort and Suricata use rules written in a specific syntax. You can download pre-built rule sets or create your own custom rules.

**Example Snort Rule:**

```
alert tcp any any -> 192.168.1.100 23 (msg:"Telnet connection attempt"; flags:S; sid:1000001; rev:1;)
```

This rule alerts you when a Telnet connection attempt is made to the host `192.168.1.100`.

**Step 3: Monitor Traffic**

Once configured, Snort/Suricata will monitor network traffic and generate alerts based on the defined rules.

## Best Practices for Network Scanning and Defense

* **Ethical Considerations:** Only scan networks and systems that you have permission to scan.
* **Understand the Risks:** Network scanning can be detected and may trigger alarms.
* **Use appropriate scanning techniques:** Choose the right scan type based on your needs and the target environment.
* **Interpret Results Carefully:** Analyze scan results thoroughly and investigate potential vulnerabilities.
* **Keep Rules Updated:** Regularly update Snort/Suricata rules to stay protected against the latest threats.

## Conclusion

This tutorial provided an introduction to network scanning with Nmap and intrusion detection with Snort and Suricata. Understanding these tools and concepts is crucial for maintaining a secure network environment. Continue exploring Nmap's advanced features and experiment with Snort/Suricata rules to enhance your network security skills. Remember to always practice ethical hacking and obtain proper authorization before conducting any security assessments.
