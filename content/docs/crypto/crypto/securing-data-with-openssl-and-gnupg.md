## Introduction

This tutorial explores the fundamentals of encryption and hashing, two essential cryptographic techniques for securing data. We'll delve into symmetric and asymmetric encryption algorithms, providing hands-on exercises with OpenSSL and GnuPG for encryption and decryption. Additionally, we'll explore different hashing algorithms and their applications using tools like HashCalc and md5deep.

### Encryption

Encryption is the process of converting plaintext data into ciphertext, making it unreadable without the proper decryption key.

**Symmetric Encryption:**

Symmetric encryption uses the same key for both encryption and decryption.

**Examples:**

* **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard):** A widely used symmetric encryption algorithm.
* **DES (Data Encryption Standard):** An older symmetric encryption algorithm that is now considered insecure.

**Hands-on with OpenSSL:**

OpenSSL is a powerful command-line tool for various cryptographic operations, including symmetric encryption.

**Example: Encrypting a File with AES**

```bash
openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -salt -in plaintext.txt -out ciphertext.enc -pass pass:"your_password"
```

This command encrypts `plaintext.txt` using AES-256 in CBC mode with a password-derived key.

**Example: Decrypting a File with AES**

```bash
openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -d -in ciphertext.enc -out decrypted.txt -pass pass:"your_password"
```

This command decrypts `ciphertext.enc` using the same password.

**Asymmetric Encryption:**

Asymmetric encryption uses two separate keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption.

**Examples:**

* **RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman):** A widely used asymmetric encryption algorithm.
* **ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography):** A newer asymmetric encryption algorithm that offers better performance for smaller key sizes.

**Hands-on with GnuPG:**

GnuPG (GNU Privacy Guard) is a complete and free implementation of the OpenPGP standard, used for secure communication and data encryption.

**Example: Generating a Key Pair**

```bash
gpg --gen-key
```

Follow the prompts to generate a new RSA key pair.

**Example: Encrypting a File with a Public Key**

```bash
gpg --encrypt --recipient recipient_email@example.com -o ciphertext.gpg plaintext.txt
```

This command encrypts `plaintext.txt` using the recipient's public key.

**Example: Decrypting a File with a Private Key**

```bash
gpg --decrypt ciphertext.gpg
```

This command decrypts `ciphertext.gpg` using your private key.

### Hashing

Hashing is the process of creating a unique, fixed-size fingerprint of data. Hashing is a one-way function, meaning it's impossible to reverse the process and retrieve the original data from the hash.

**Examples:**

* **MD5 (Message Digest Algorithm 5):** An older hashing algorithm that is now considered insecure for cryptographic purposes.
* **SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1):** Another older hashing algorithm that is also considered insecure.
* **SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit):** A widely used and secure hashing algorithm.

**Hands-on with HashCalc:**

HashCalc is a free tool that calculates various hash values for files or text strings.

**Example: Calculating the SHA-256 Hash of a File**

Open HashCalc, select the SHA-256 algorithm, and browse to the file you want to hash. Click "Calculate" to generate the hash value.

**Hands-on with md5deep:**

md5deep is a command-line tool that can calculate various hash values for files and directories recursively.

**Example: Calculating MD5 Hashes Recursively**

```bash
md5deep -r directory_path
```

This command calculates MD5 hashes for all files within the specified directory and its subdirectories.

## Best Practices for Encryption and Hashing

* **Use Strong Algorithms:** Choose strong and well-vetted encryption and hashing algorithms.
* **Key Management:** Securely store and manage your encryption keys.
* **Salt Your Hashes:** Use a unique salt for each hashed password to prevent rainbow table attacks.
* **Data Integrity:** Use hashing to verify data integrity and detect tampering.
