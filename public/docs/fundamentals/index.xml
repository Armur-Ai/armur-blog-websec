      <description>Introduction linkThis tutorial explores essential concepts in network security, focusing on network scanning with Nmap, understanding IP addressing and subnetting, and introducing intrusion detection systems (IDS) like Snort and Suricata.&#xA;IP Addressing and Subnetting linkEvery device connected to a network needs a unique identifier, which is its IP address. IP addresses are used to route traffic across networks. Subnetting is the process of dividing a large network into smaller, more manageable subnetworks.</description>

      <description>Introduction linkThis tutorial dives deep into the core protocols that power the internet: TCP/IP and HTTP(S). We will explore their functionalities, how they interact, and how to analyze network traffic using the powerful packet analyzer, Wireshark. Understanding these concepts is crucial for anyone interested in network security, web development, or simply gaining a deeper understanding of how the internet works.&#xA;What is TCP/IP? linkTCP/IP stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol. It&amp;rsquo;s a suite of networking protocols that define how data is transmitted across the internet.</description>
